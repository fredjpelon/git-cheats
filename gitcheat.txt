I started my journey here,

(Gwen is awesome!)

The youtube video linked above is a very basic start to using git and gitHub; highly recommended.
The instructions below are for my starting setup which is a Windows box (running W11).
To get started, get a gitHub account (apparently there are many other choices for repo storage:
I used gitHub).
Load the git app to your local machine.
I am using VSCode as my code editor, same as Gwen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a repo online and populate it starting with gitHub (as opposed to starting on your local
machine)
Nav to github.com and log in to your account
Click green 'New'
Enter repo name (this one is called git-cheats for example).
Enter description.
Click green 'Create repository'
Click the hard-to-see link 'creating a new file'
Name the new file README.md and enter some markdown text
Click green 'Commit changes...'
Click green 'Commit changes'
In your editor nav to a clean directory.
In gitHub, click on repo name to get back to repo home.
Click on green '<> Code' dropdown and copy the https linki shown.
In your editor, open a terminal and enter,

git clone <link you just copied>

cd into new directory
Add/modify/create files in new directory.
Get the status of all files.

git status

Tell git to track all files.

git add .

Commit files to repo.

git commit -m "Title goes here" -m "Description goes here"
